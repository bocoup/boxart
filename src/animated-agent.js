/**
 * AnimatedAgent
 *
 * Work with Animated wrapped React components to animate around the screen.
 *
 * AnimatedAgent and Animated can be used very simply to have a React component
 * animate from one area of the window to another area. By default an Animated
 * triggers an animation with the agent any time it goes through its render
 * lifecycle. For easy use the default animation will animate linearly from its
 * last location to the current location.
 *
 * Animateds can animate a React component from a previous hierarchy to a new
 * hierarchy. Say you have two lists and want to animate one of the list items
 * from one list to the other. As long as the old React element and the new one
 * in the new list has an Animated wrapping element with the same animateKey,
 * the agent will use the last remembered position and start an animation with
 * that last position and the new one.
